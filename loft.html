            <h3>Loft Conversion Types</h3>
            <p>When considering a loft conversion, it is important to understand the four main variations available. Which type you decide to use for your conversion will depend on your specific ideas and how you want to utilize the space available. The design of your existing roof is important to note, as is the height and floor space, your budget, any planning restrictions, and your own personal preferences. Roof light and Velux conversions are the same. Velux are the leading manufacturer in the UK for roof windows with over 50 years' experience producing windows. Velux conversions are usually very cost-effective and don’t normally need planning permission. A dormer conversion is an extension to your existing roof, which will allow for additional floor space and headroom. Dormer loft conversions can protrude from the roof slope at the rear of the property. These conversions can be built in a wide variety of styles and sizes. The interior of a dormer will normally have a standard horizontal ceiling with vertical walls, compared to the normal diagonal sides of a conversion. Although these types of conversions are not always the most attractive from the outside, flat roof dormer loft conversions can give you a maximum amount of additional internal space. A mansard roof has two slopes, the lower slope is close to vertical at 72 degrees and the top section of the roof is almost horizontal. This style of roof is named after a 17th-century French architect Francois Mansard (1598-1666) who used this design of roof on many of his buildings. A mansard roof has the advantage of maximizing the available space within your loft. A hip to gable conversion can mean major changes to the roof. The gable wall is built up to the ridgeline and a new section of roof is built to fill the gap. As a rule, properties with hip roofs tend not to have enough internal space for a conversion to be practical, so a hip to gable conversion is the best solution. With your imagination and ideas and with our professional help, your loft could be transformed into a versatile living space. A loft conversion allows you to add space without having to move and will probably add value to your property as well. Loft conversions vary enormously in both cost and make-up. This partly depends on the size and the shape of the roof. Simple roof shapes are invariably easier to convert, but also much depends on how you choose to use your living space.

            <h3>Stairs to Loft</h3>
            <p>Getting the Right Loft Stairs for Your New Conversion is important. Without a doubt adding the loft stairs is one of the most important elements, in both an aesthetic and practical sense, of your new Loft Conversion. Getting the staircase and access right will have a massive bearing on the success of your project but the Building Regulations throw up a number of things that you will need to consider when planning your staircase to the loft. Adding a new floor or story to a home requires a permanent staircase except when a basic storage solution is being built. In a very few instances a fixed ladder can be used but the vast majority of conversions will need a staircase. In any event, it is highly unlikely that you would even consider a ladder. The usual solution is a traditional flight of stairs. Installing this style of access is usually straight-forward though it is desirable that there be a clear 2m of headroom though 1.8m or sometimes less can be worked around. We also have over 10 years' experience in Loft Conversions, House Extensions and House Refurbishments. Whatever your requirements or ideas please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

            <h3>Loft Conversion Requirements</h3>
            <p>Provided there is sufficient headroom, most roofs can be converted. You need to think about what type of conversion you want, where the stairs will go and what changes may be needed to the plumbing system. There are main types of roof construction, the traditional rafter and purlin or the modern trussed roof. Generally, the older type of roof is easier to convert as it has a steep pitch that gives the headroom required. Most houses built before the 1960s will have the traditional rafter and purlin design. As a general rule you will need a minimum height of 2.3 metres across around half of the floor area to make a conversion worthwhile. There isn't much point having an extra room if you can't stand up in it! An important consideration is where the stairs for the new loft conversion will go. A common solution is to remove an airing cupboard which is often on the first-floor landing this leaves a convenient space for the stairs but means that the hot water cylinder needs to be either removed or re located. Sometimes part of an existing bedroom is used for the stairs, we do not recommend this approach unless you have very large bedrooms as the lost space detracts from the benefits of the additional bedroom in the loft. We, also have many year’s experience in Loft Conversions and House Extension. Whatever your requirements or ideas please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
