            <h3>Basement Build</h3>
            <p>Building a basement involves a series of crucial steps to ensure a successful project. First, prepare rough plans based on your ideas for the build. Next, appoint an architect who can apply for necessary planning permissions and building regulations. We can provide you with estimates and assist in securing the required financing. It’s essential to discuss all requirements thoroughly, ensuring everything is documented with an agreed-upon price. Verify with your builder regarding the inclusion or exclusion of furniture and fittings, as clients typically purchase their own selections. Following this, work out drainage and water extraction systems, support the main structure, and dig out the soil underneath. Once the groundwork is laid, install stairs, windows, and doors as required, and create internal partitions if needed. Proceed with first fixing electrics, plumbing, and telecommunications, then insulate walls and floors before finishing with plaster. Install heating systems, carry out second fixing of electrics, plumbing, and telecoms, and fit internal doors, skirting, and other carpentry. Finally, decorate and furnish the space, including flooring and lighting. Ensure you obtain all appropriate certificates, including planning permission, building control, and Thames Water approvals. With years of experience in new builds, extensions, kitchen, and bathroom installations, we are here to help with your requirements or ideas.</p>

            <h3>New Built</h3>
            <p>Here are the key steps for your new build: prepare the rough plans for your ideas to build, appoint the architect, who can apply for planning permission and building regulations if required. We can provide you with estimates, and you'll need to secure financing. Discuss all requirements and get everything in writing with an agreed price. Double-check with the builder regarding furniture and fittings, as typically, the client will purchase furniture of their choice, and the builder will fit this. Work out the drainage and water extractions, support the main structure, and dig out the soil underneath. Install stairs, windows, and doors if required, and create internal partitions if needed. First fix electrics, plumbing, and telecommunications, insulate the walls and floor, finish the walls and plaster, and install the heating. Then, second fix electrics, plumbing, and telecommunications, fit internal doors, skirting, and other carpentry, and decorate and furnish, including flooring and lighting. Finally, obtain the appropriate certificates—planning permission, building control, and Thames Water. With many years of experience in new builds, extensions, kitchen installations, and bathroom installations, we are well-equipped to turn your vision into reality.
